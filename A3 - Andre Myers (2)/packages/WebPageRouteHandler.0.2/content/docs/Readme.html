    The WebPages.Route.Helper is a simple abstraction to Asp.Net Web Pages. Routing allows you to have urls that do not map to physical files on disk enabling you to create user friendly urls. For more details on how routing works in Asp.Net, visit <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201.aspx</a>

    This package contains samples on adding routes under the docs folder. Have a look at how routes are declared in _AppStart.cshtml and how route parameters are used in the pages. The sample pages are functional, so if you copy them to the root of your website, you should see routing in action.
